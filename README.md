Elevator Pitch:
    Have you ever wanted to talk about a book that you really enjoy but nobody around you has read it or already knows the ending? Well fear not, for this application is here to help your creative mind! Book discuss is an application dedicated to connecting you with others who are at the same part of the book and therefore cannot spoil it but will have a genuine discussion with you. Especially useful for individuals who wish to create their own spinoff stories, such as authors and dungeon masters. The best part is that this application is dedicated to being spoiler free, so you can discuss away with others without anyone actually knowing the end and thus ruining the book. (Potentially can also work with tv shows).
